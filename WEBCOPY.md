**THE Business School – HOMEPAGE**

## **Hero Section**

**Headline:** Transform the World at your Terms

**Subheadline:** Business education that meet your needs and at a price that actually makes sense.

## **About THE Business School**

Let's be direct: most people can't afford an MBA that serves their ambition for growth, that least disrupts their lives and at costs they can afford. Not because they're not smart enough or capable enough, or existing MBA programmes are not higher quality, but because quality-price envelope has largely gone out of sync.

THE Business School exists to change that equation.

We deliver rigorous curriculum with qualified faculty, comprehensive resources, and meaningful credentials—at a fraction of what you'd expect to pay. How? We've built our model around what actually matters for your learning.

**What we focus on:**

* Faculty with PhDs, real-world experience and knowledge of how to teach   
* Curriculum that meets international standards   
* Resources, support, and networks to help you succeed   
* Flexible delivery that fits your life 

**What we don't spend on:**

* Expensive physical facilities   
* Premium real estate   
* Infrastructure that doesn't directly serve your education 

**The result?** An MBA program that makes financial sense. You study online, in public spaces: libraries, cafés, community centers and so on for bursts of intensive sessions. You maintain your income. You stay connected to your work, your community, and your life.

This isn't a compromise. It's a smarter design.

## **Who This Is For**

**You should be here if:**

* You need an MBA to advance your career, launch a venture, or pivot into new work   
* You want to solve unique problems and looking to go beyond a generic education educational journey  
* You're building something real and need the tools to do it right   
* You want your education to serve your goals, fit your life and be fun. 

**You'll thrive here if:**

* You're self-directed and can manage flexible learning   
* You have clear purpose for pursuing this degree   
* You're ready to do rigorous work   
* You want to connect theory to practice constantly 

We're building this for people who want results, not those who may be looking for a document to show that they have studied, even though we also offer you documents to show your outstanding achievements to potential collaborators, employers and the likes.

## **Our Capstone Programme – MBA in Social Business & Entrepreneurship**

This is a focused MBA designed for people solving real problems.

**The focus:** You're building something that matters. Maybe it's a social enterprise. Maybe it's a business serving underserved markets, a non-profit. Maybe it's transforming an existing organization or innovating within the government, or even creating an opportunity where none exists.

You need to understand finance, operations, strategy, marketing—the full toolkit. But you also need to understand poverty economics, development challenges, ethical leadership, and how to build sustainable models in complex environments.

**The approach:** Core business fundamentals taught for real-world application. We teach you how business actually works in contexts where resources are constrained, institutions are evolving, and impact matters alongside revenue.

**The delivery:** Hybrid learning that fits your life. Core content delivered through our integrated online platform. Live sessions via video conference. Periodic in-person gatherings in public spaces for workshops, guest speakers, and collaborative work. Self-directed projects applying concepts to your actual challenges.

**Industry adaptations:** Each cohort focuses on a specific sector—agriculture, sports, fashion, ethnic business, technology, whatever fits your work. Same core content, but cases, examples, guest faculty, and projects mirror your industry. You're learning how this applies to the work you're actually doing.

## **The Curriculum: What You'll Actually Learn**

This program teaches you how to run a business and how to run it well.

**Management Fundamentals** — You'll master the core disciplines every leader needs: finance and accounting, marketing, operations, organizational behavior, strategy. Not theory for theory's sake, but frameworks you'll use to make better decisions, allocate resources effectively, and build competitive advantage.

**Analytical Methods** — You'll develop the ability to work with data, conduct rigorous research, use new technologies including AI, and make evidence-based decisions. In a world drowning in information, the skill is knowing what matters and how to interpret it.

**Leadership Capabilities** — You'll learn to lead teams, navigate organizational dynamics, manage conflict, build culture, and make ethical decisions under pressure. Leadership isn't a personality trait. It's a set of learnable skills.

**Specialized Knowledge for Impact** — Deep training in development economics, bottom-of-the-pyramid business models, social entrepreneurship, and innovation in constrained environments. You'll understand why poverty persists, how institutions shape outcomes, and how to design businesses that create value for populations others overlook.

**Applied Experience & Research** — Throughout the program, you'll work on real ventures and real problems. Entrepreneurship lab. Student projects. Competitions. Guest practitioner sessions. Rigorous research addressing questions unique to your challenges—market analyses, feasibility studies, impact assessments. The goal isn't just to know things—it's to do things and generate new solutions through systematic inquiry.

The curriculum is rigorous because business is hard. We're here to make you capable.

## **Beyond the Classroom: THE Think Tank**

Your learning extends beyond courses. THE Think Tank is our collaborative research and innovation platform where students, alumni, faculty, partners, and practitioners work together on real challenges.

Here you'll conduct research that matters to your work, collaborate on projects addressing development and business problems, participate in industry working groups, test ideas before committing major resources, and build partnerships that continue long after graduation.

This isn't academic research for publication's sake. It's research that informs decisions, validates approaches, and generates solutions you can use.

## **Why This Works**

**For you personally:** You get an MBA without financial devastation or putting your life on hold. You can apply what you're learning immediately to your work. You build a network of people solving similar problems in different contexts. You're treated as a professional who can manage your own time and learning.

**For your career:** You acquire credentials that matter. More importantly, you develop actual competence—the ability to analyze complex situations, design solutions, lead implementation, and conduct research that generates new insights. You'll be able to deliver results that matter.

**For what you're building:** Whether it's a venture, an organization, a community initiative—you'll have the strategic frameworks and operational tools to do it sustainably. You'll understand how to read financial statements, design business models, validate markets, manage people, raise capital, measure impact, and research questions specific to your context. You'll make fewer expensive mistakes.

**For accessibility:** Every person we educate at a price they can afford expands who gets access to quality business education. Every successful graduate demonstrates that talent and determination drive success. This model scales. As we grow, education becomes more accessible.

## **What Drives Us**

We're focused on one thing: delivering exceptional business education to people who need it. We believe access to knowledge shouldn't depend on wealth. We believe quality and affordability aren't opposites. We believe education should serve students, not the other way around.

We've designed everything—our model, our delivery, our pricing—around these beliefs.

## **Ready to Start?**

Stop waiting for the "right time." Stop letting cost barriers delay what you're meant to build. The knowledge exists. The faculty exists. The technology to deliver it exists.

The only question is whether you're ready to do the work.

Education that works for you.

**Page 2: Our Model \[How THE Business School Works\]**

We've built a business school around a simple idea: eliminate every cost that doesn't directly improve your learning.

Most of what makes education expensive has nothing to do with education. It's real estate. It's buildings that sit empty most of the time. It's administrative overhead managing physical infrastructure. It's location premiums for prestigious addresses.

We don't have those costs. So you don't pay for them.

## **Our Operating Model**

### **1\. Platform-First Infrastructure**

Our primary educational infrastructure is digital. We've built an integrated platform that handles everything: complete learning management system with all course materials, assignments, and assessments; video conferencing for live sessions with faculty and classmates; collaborative workspaces for team projects; resource libraries with cases, readings, and tools; academic administration and progress tracking; career services and professional development; alumni networking.

This platform serves as your central hub. It's accessible 24/7 from anywhere. It scales efficiently—serving ten students costs roughly the same as serving a thousand.

The investment we make in technology infrastructure would, in a traditional model, go toward buildings. The difference? Buildings serve dozens. Our platform serves hundreds, eventually thousands. And it gets better with use, not worse.

### **2\. Hybrid Delivery Using Public Spaces**

Learning happens in different ways. Some things work well online. Others benefit from face-to-face interaction.

When in-person sessions create real value, we use spaces that already exist: public libraries for focused work and small group discussions, community centers for workshops and collaborative sessions, cafés and co-working spaces for informal team meetings, event venues for larger gatherings and guest lectures, partner organization facilities for industry-specific learning.

We pay only for the time we actually use these spaces. No mortgages. No maintenance. No utility bills for empty rooms.

This approach offers several advantages beyond cost: geographic flexibility allowing us to run programs in multiple cities simultaneously, real-world integration where you learn in environments where business actually happens, accessibility through familiar spaces without intimidation barriers, community connection as local venues strengthen relationships with the communities we serve.

### **3\. Expert Faculty, Flexible Structure**

We employ faculty who can teach at the highest level: core faculty with PhDs and extensive teaching experience who design curriculum and maintain quality standards, industry practitioners who bring current sector-specific expertise, project mentors who guide applied learning and venture development, global talent accessed through video conferencing regardless of physical location.

This structure lets us match the right expertise to each learning need without carrying the fixed costs of large tenured faculty bodies or paying premium salaries for expensive city locations.

Our faculty are paid fairly for their work. We simply don't have the overhead that inflates those costs beyond reason.

### **4\. Industry-Adaptive Curriculum**

Rather than building separate programs for each sector, we've designed a core curriculum that adapts: foundation content remains consistent across all cohorts covering fundamental management, finance, analytics, and leadership; application changes by industry with cases, projects, and guest faculty reflecting the specific sector each cohort serves; cohort structure enables customization so agriculture, fashion, and sports cohorts all get the same core knowledge applied differently.

This model maximizes efficiency in curriculum development while delivering personalized, relevant education. We develop once, adapt efficiently, deliver with precision.

### **5\. Research Infrastructure for Real Questions**

Students don't just learn existing frameworks—they generate new knowledge addressing their specific challenges. Our platform and Think Tank provide research support: access to databases and analytical tools, faculty mentorship on research design and methodology, collaboration opportunities with peers investigating similar questions, frameworks for conducting rigorous market research, feasibility studies, and impact assessments.

This research capability means you can investigate questions unique to your context—questions existing literature may not address. You learn research methods then apply them to problems you're actually trying to solve.

### **6\. Matching What People Need with What We Offer**

Our model works because we're serving real demand that existing options don't address well.

**Who needs this:** Professionals who need an MBA but can't afford six-figure debt, people with family or work responsibilities requiring flexible study, entrepreneurs building ventures in non-traditional sectors, leaders in developing regions where local options are limited, anyone who values knowledge over brand names.

**What we provide:** High-quality curriculum at accessible pricing, flexible delivery that accommodates real lives, industry-relevant content for sectors others ignore, learning focused on application not just theory, research support for your specific questions, community of people solving similar challenges.

We're not trying to serve everyone. We're focused on serving this specific population extremely well.

## **Why This Model Works**

### **Financial Sustainability**

Our economics are straightforward.

**Low fixed costs:** No campus, no buildings, no infrastructure maintenance. Our major fixed cost is platform development and core faculty.

**Variable costs that scale:** As enrollment grows, we add faculty capacity and space rental as needed. Costs increase roughly proportionally with students.

**Accessible pricing:** By keeping overhead low, we can charge tuition that working professionals can afford while still covering our costs and investing in quality.

**Reinvestment model:** Surplus revenue goes back into improving the platform, expanding faculty, developing new industry adaptations, and providing student support.

This creates a sustainable cycle: more students → more resources for quality → better outcomes → stronger reputation → more students who benefit.

### **Educational Effectiveness**

Hybrid learning isn't a second-best option. For working professionals, it's often superior.

**Immediate application:** You learn something Monday, apply it to your actual work Tuesday. The feedback loop between theory and practice is days, not years.

**Maintained context:** You stay embedded in your work environment, seeing real organizational dynamics while studying them.

**Research integration:** You investigate questions directly relevant to your work, generating insights applicable immediately to your challenges.

**Diverse perspectives:** Classmates aren't all from the same geography or similar backgrounds. You're learning with people solving problems across different contexts.

**Technology preparation:** You're already working the way modern businesses work—distributed teams, digital collaboration, remote communication.

### **Scalability**

This model can grow: platform costs don't increase proportionally with users, public spaces exist everywhere allowing us to launch in new cities without infrastructure investment, faculty can teach remotely expanding our talent pool globally, industry adaptations can be replicated across geographies, each successful cohort strengthens the model for the next.

We can serve ten times our current size without fundamentally changing how we operate.

## 

## **Value Created**

### **For You as a Student**

**Financial value:** You get an MBA for a fraction of typical cost. The absence of crushing debt means faster ROI, more freedom in career choices, and resources available for building your venture rather than repaying loans.

**Time value:** You don't pause your career. You're earning income, building experience, maintaining momentum while getting educated.

**Learning value:** Curriculum quality matches international standards. Faculty qualifications are comparable to top programs. You're not sacrificing educational rigor for affordability.

**Applied value:** What you learn gets used immediately. Your assignments can be your actual work challenges. Your projects can be your real ventures. Education becomes integrated with action.

**Research capability:** You develop the ability to investigate questions systematically, validate assumptions rigorously, and generate solutions grounded in evidence rather than guesswork.

**Network value:** Your classmates are practitioners, entrepreneurs, builders—people doing real things. These relationships often become partnerships, collaborations, support systems.

**Flexibility value:** You study when it works for you. You balance family, work, community. You maintain the life you've built while advancing your capabilities.

### **For Your Work and Ventures**

**Strategic capability:** You'll analyze competitive environments, position offerings, allocate resources, and execute plans.

**Financial literacy:** You'll read balance sheets, build financial models, evaluate investments, manage cash flow, and make sound financial decisions.

**Operational competence:** You'll design efficient processes, manage supply chains, optimize systems, and scale operations.

**Leadership skills:** You'll build teams, manage performance, navigate conflict, create culture, and lead change.

**Market understanding:** You'll validate ideas, understand customer needs, develop positioning, and create go-to-market strategies through systematic research.

**Problem-solving capacity:** You'll know how to investigate questions unique to your context, generate evidence-based solutions, and adapt approaches based on what you discover.

**Credibility:** An MBA signals competence to partners, investors, employers, and stakeholders. It opens doors.

### **For Communities and Markets**

**Economic opportunity:** Educated entrepreneurs create businesses. Businesses create jobs. Jobs create income. Income creates opportunity for others.

**Better solutions:** When more people can access business education and research capabilities, more diverse perspectives inform how businesses are built and problems are solved.

**New knowledge:** Research conducted by students and faculty addresses questions specific to underserved markets, generating solutions that don't exist in conventional business literature.

**Market development:** Businesses serving underserved populations expand when founders have both the management tools and the research capabilities to build them sustainably.

**Institutional strengthening:** NGOs, social enterprises, community organizations become more effective when their leaders understand management fundamentals and can conduct rigorous program evaluation.

**Knowledge diffusion:** What you learn and discover doesn't stay with you. You teach others, mentor emerging leaders, share research findings, strengthen your ecosystem.

**Demonstration effect:** Every successful graduate proves that access and quality aren't trade-offs. This challenges assumptions about who deserves education.

## **What Makes This Sustainable Long-Term**

**Aligned incentives:** Our success depends on your success. If graduates thrive, more students enroll. If we deliver value, our reputation grows. We win when you win.

**Market positioning:** We're serving growing, underserved markets rather than competing in saturated ones. Demand exceeds supply.

**Operational efficiency:** Low overhead and technology leverage create healthy margins at accessible prices.

**Quality focus:** We maintain standards because reputation is everything. One bad cohort damages everything we're building.

**Community effects:** As alumni networks grow, value increases for everyone. Each cohort strengthens the community supporting all cohorts.

**Adaptability:** Our model can respond to changing needs—new industries, new technologies, new delivery methods—without massive capital requirements.

## ***Core Insight***

*Traditional business schools built their models in an era when physical presence was necessary for education delivery. That constraint no longer exists.*

*We're not cutting corners. We're cutting costs that don't serve learning.*

*We're not lowering standards. We're eliminating barriers.*

*We're not offering less. We're delivering more of what actually matters.*

*The question was never whether quality business education could be affordable. It was whether anyone would build a model designed around that goal.*

*We have.*

# **PAGE 3: FACULTY**

## **Our Faculty: Expertise That Serves Your Goals**

We hire people who can teach and people who know what they're talking about. That's it. 

Our faculty hold advanced degrees from respected institutions. They've published research. They've built businesses, advised organizations, worked in the sectors they teach about. They know their subjects deeply and they know how to help you learn them.

We don't hire based on prestige or pedigree. We hire based on whether someone can make complex ideas clear, whether they've done the work they're teaching, and whether they're committed to your success.

Below are profiles representing the kind of faculty you'll learn from. These aren't theoretical ideals—this is the caliber of educator we recruit and the diversity of experience we bring to your learning.

### **Dr. Felix Rafiki**

*Assistant Professor of Social Entrepreneurship & Innovation*

**Background:** PhD in Management from University of Carrickmore. MBA from Swancity. Fifteen years building and advising social enterprises across West Africa, including serving as Chief Innovation Officer for a major microfinance institution reaching 200,000 clients.

**What he teaches:** Social venture strategy, bottom-of-the-pyramid business models, scaling in resource-constrained environments, cross-sector partnerships.

**What she brings to students:** Dr. Rafiki has built the kinds of ventures many students aspire to create. She knows what works in theory and what actually works when you're operating with limited capital in complex institutional environments. Her networks across Africa provide students access to real opportunities and partnerships.

She teaches case studies from her own ventures—including the failures. Students learn not just frameworks but the messy reality of implementation.

**Why he's here:** "I spent years learning expensive lessons. I teach so students can skip some of those lessons and move faster to what actually matters—building things that last and create real value for people who need it."

**THE Business School**  
Faculty who teach. Students who learn. Results that matter.

# **PAGE 4: SUPPLEMENTARY SERVICES \- THE Think Tank**

## **THE Think Tank: Where Learning Continues**

The MBA gives you tools. THE Think Tank gives you a place to use them.

This isn't an academic research center publishing papers nobody reads. It's a working space where students, alumni, partners, and practitioners collaborate on actual problems. Where ideas get tested. Where projects get built. Where people who are trying to solve real challenges find others doing the same.

## **What It Is**

THE Think Tank is a collaborative platform—both digital and physical—where people come together to work on things that matter.

**Who participates:** Current students applying what they're learning, alumni continuing to develop ventures and projects, faculty exploring questions that need answering, partner organizations needing analytical support or fresh thinking, community members with expertise to contribute, and practitioners working on specific challenges.

**What happens here:** Projects addressing real business and development problems, research that informs decisions and generates new solutions, workshops where people work together intensively, conversations with practitioners and experts, testing ideas before committing major resources, and building collaborations and partnerships.

It's structured enough to be productive. Flexible enough to respond to what people actually need.

## **Core Activities**

### **Research That Solves Problems**

Research at THE Think Tank addresses questions that matter to people building things. This isn't research for publication's sake. It's research to inform decisions, validate approaches, and generate new solutions.

Students and faculty conduct rigorous research on questions like: What business models work for smallholder farmers in specific regions? How do microenterprises in informal economies access capital? What factors determine success for women-led ventures in particular sectors? How can technology improve service delivery in resource-constrained settings?

The research produces practical outputs—market analyses, feasibility studies, implementation guides, policy recommendations. Everything gets shared openly so others facing similar challenges can learn from it.

### **Industry Working Groups**

Ongoing communities organized around specific sectors: Agriculture & Food Systems, Financial Inclusion & Fintech, Sustainable Fashion & Supply Chains, Education & Skills Development, Health Systems & Access, Climate & Environmental Business, Women's Economic Empowerment, Technology for Social Impact.

Groups meet monthly in hybrid format. Members share insights, discuss challenges, collaborate on common problems, conduct sector-specific research, and build collective knowledge.

These aren't networking groups. They're working groups. You participate because you're doing something in that space and need the expertise and perspective others bring.

### **Learning From Practitioners**

Regular sessions with people doing the work—entrepreneurs sharing what they've learned building ventures, investors explaining what they look for, policymakers discussing how decisions get made, operators explaining how they solved specific problems.

These aren't motivational speeches. They're knowledge transfer—specific insights you can use.

Sessions are hybrid. Recordings available for those who can't attend live.

### **Venture Development Support**

For people building businesses or organizations: feedback sessions where you present your model and get constructive critique, office hours with faculty and experienced entrepreneurs, help validating markets and testing assumptions, connections to potential partners and investors.

This isn't formal incubation. It's ongoing support from people who know what you're going through and can help you think more clearly.

This isn't formal incubation. It's ongoing support from people who know what you're going through and can help you think more clearly.

## **How It Works**

### **For Students**

Think Tank is integrated into your learning. Many course projects involve Think Tank collaboration, you can propose independent research aligned with your interests, you participate in working groups relevant to your focus, and you build relationships that often continue beyond graduation.

Some students treat it as supplementary. Others make it central to their experience. It adapts to how you want to engage.

### **For Alumni**

Think Tank provides continued connection and support. You get ongoing access to expertise when facing new challenges, collaboration opportunities with students and other alumni, a platform for ventures you're building or leading, and learning that doesn't stop when coursework ends.

Alumni often contribute as much as they take—mentoring students, sharing expertise, bringing projects that create learning opportunities for current cohorts, conducting research on questions emerging in their work.

### **For Partners and Organizations**

Think Tank offers analytical capacity and fresh perspectives. Submit challenges your organization is facing, work with student teams on specific projects, access faculty expertise for particular questions, participate in sector working groups, commission research on questions you need answered.

Some engagements are pro bono. Others are fee-based depending on scope and resources required. The goal is mutual value—you get meaningful support, students get real-world learning.

### **For Community Members and Practitioners**

If you have expertise relevant to what we're working on, you can contribute. Join working groups in your area of knowledge, attend open events and sessions, offer specific expertise for particular projects, propose collaborative research that addresses community needs.

This isn't exclusive. If you're working on something that aligns with Think Tank focus areas, you can participate.

This isn't exclusive. If you're working on something that aligns with Think Tank focus areas, you can participate.

## **What Gets Produced**

**For ventures and organizations:** Business plans and financial models, market research and feasibility studies, strategic plans and implementation roadmaps.

**For knowledge building:** Research reports addressing specific questions and generating new solutions, case studies documenting what worked and what didn't, guides and tools others can use, policy briefs for decision-makers.

**For participants:** Networks of collaborators and thought partners, portfolio work demonstrating capabilities, refined ideas and validated approaches, connections to opportunities and resources.

Everything produced is shared openly unless there are specific confidentiality needs. The goal is learning and impact, not proprietary knowledge.

## **Where It Happens**

**Digital Platform:** Primary workspace for ongoing collaboration, project management tools and shared documents, discussion forums for asynchronous work, resource library with cases and research, calendar of events and sessions, matching system connecting people with complementary skills. Accessible anytime, anywhere.

**Physical Sessions:** Consistent with THE Business School model, Think Tank uses public and partner spaces. Monthly gatherings in community centers or event venues, working group meetings in libraries or cafés, intensive workshops in co-working spaces, field research in communities where challenges exist. Location varies based on what makes sense for the specific activity.

## **Signature Programs**

**Annual Transformation Summit** A full-day convening bringing together social entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, academics, practitioners. Features workshops, venture showcases, panel discussions, collaborative sessions, and presentation of significant Think Tank research findings. Each year addresses a specific theme relevant to current challenges.

**Venture Challenge** Annual competition where students and external participants pitch ventures addressing specific development or social challenges. Winners receive seed funding, mentorship, and Think Tank support for implementation.

**Practitioner-in-Residence** Each term, an accomplished entrepreneur or development practitioner teaches a seminar sharing their expertise, mentors students on projects, works on their own strategic questions with Think Tank support, and creates connections between students and their networks.

## **Who Should Engage**

**You should participate if:** You're working on a real challenge and need perspectives beyond your own, you have expertise that could help others solve problems, you're building a venture or organization and need support, you have research questions that need rigorous investigation.

**You won't find value if:** You're looking for networking without contributing, you want theoretical discussions disconnected from application, you're not willing to share what you're learning.

This is for people who are building things, researching real questions, and helping others do the same.

## **The Practical Reality**

Think Tank operates on limited resources. We can't support every project, provide deep expertise in every domain, or solve every problem.

What we can do: connect you with others facing similar challenges, provide structured frameworks for working through problems, support rigorous research on questions that matter to your work, offer diverse perspectives that improve your thinking, link you to resources and people who can help.

Sometimes that's enough to unlock what you need. Sometimes you'll need more specialized support elsewhere. We're honest about what we can and can't provide.
